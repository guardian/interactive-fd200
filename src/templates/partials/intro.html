        <p>This year is Frederick Douglassâ€™s Bicentennial celebration. After escaping slavery at the age of 20, Douglass went on to become one of America's most celebrated abolitionists - tirelessly campaigning against slavery. One of the most influential figures in US history has ever known not just as an abolitionist, but as a politician, writer, feminist, educator, entrepreneur and diplomat.</p>

        <p>The Frederick Douglass 200 is a project to honor the work of 200 living Americans who best embody the work and spirit of Douglass across those areas where he had such an impact - abolitionist, politician, writer, feminist, educator, entrepreneur and diplomat.</p>

        <p>The FD200 has been curated and compiled by the Frederick Douglass Family Initiatives (FDFI), and the Guardian is pleased to partner with them to publish this list. Each week, between now and November ??, we will publish a list of 10 new people who have joined the FD200. All awardees will be honored at the Library of Congress in Washington DC in February next year.</p>
